	abstract = {Nowadays, a large number of children and adolescents have made use of social applications. Easy to access, these applications provide benefits and opportunities. However, at the same time, they expose users to different risks, including predatory sexual activity. Predatory sexual activity has several purposes, such as obtaining child pornography, extortion, and sexual abuse. The present work has three main objectives: (i) to create a data set of textual conversations containing a real predatory sexual activity for Brazilian Portuguese; (ii) to perform a statistical analysis in the data set created; (iii) to carry out an experimental evaluation considering the most popular machine learning algorithms in the research domain with the data set built. This evaluation regards F1\$ measure as a basis.  The results achieved with contributions (i) and (ii) enable new studies to focus on the problem of identifying sexual predators in textual conversations for Brazilian Portuguese. The results obtained with the contribution (iii) show that the Support Vector Machines behaved as the best of the considered algorithms, presenting a result of 89.87%.},
